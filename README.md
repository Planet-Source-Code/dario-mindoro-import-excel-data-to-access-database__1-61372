### More Info
 
Excel and Ms Access files

The excel file to be imported will be a standard table only, unpredictable error will occur if your excel contains graphics or charts. The user must know the password of the Access Database file.

The user should eliminate any blank rows in the excel before imporint, also headings of rows in excel cell must be in the very first rows so that it will become the field name or else the program will use F1, F2, etc... as the field name and the headings in your excel file will be included on the data.
